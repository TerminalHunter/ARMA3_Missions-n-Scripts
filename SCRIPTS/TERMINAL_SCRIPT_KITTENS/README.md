## Script Kittens?

Script Kiddie -> Script Kitty -> Script Kitten

The words just kinda mashed together. Anyway, these are a bunch of little scripts that are almost always welcome. Like a basket of kittens, you just kinda want to keep them around forever.

* Pick up a FirstAidKit and have it turn into a random assortment of ACE Medical items
* The corpse -> box looting script I finally got around to finishing
* Confetti!
* Probably more later

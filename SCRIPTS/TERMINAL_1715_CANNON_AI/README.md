## Shore Cannon AI for Nasssau 1715

Also included is a full-on demonstration mission.

It'd be cool to eventually figure out a full ship AI, but this is a start. Shore cannons specifically need to be attachTo'd a seperate 'anchor object' because arma physics is a bit wonky. The mission uses a wooden box. The script should quickly snap the cannon to some ridiculous angle, fire, and return to it's original position.

For a touch of realism, the shore cannon also needs a human NPC nearby - if any player is in sight of the eyePos memory position of the NPC and within range, they'll fire. 

All the range tables are hard-coded.

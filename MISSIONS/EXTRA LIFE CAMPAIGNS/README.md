##Tactical Tuesday's Annual Charity Campaign

Still in progress, run ad hoc whenever it is Extra Life's Game Day

##Prominent Features:

Has literally raised thousands of dollars for charity.
	The amount I've raised, alone, is ~$700 over 2 years.
	The rest of the team has raised a bunch more than I have.

The ability to litter within ARMA
	And custom beer can labels, to boot.
	
The ability to clean up said litter
	I still cannot believe I made an ARMA 3 mission based on cleaning litter.

Ghosts!
	Ghosts that explode into fire when shot!
	Spooky!
	
Vaguely historical!
	Vaguely!

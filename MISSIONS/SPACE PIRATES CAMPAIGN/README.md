### Prominent Features:

* Space Team minigame recreated in ARMA 3
* An attempt at a mission based on Capital Ship combat from Star Wars Battlefront (the good one)
* Arsenal system based on stealing things and replicating them.
  - Piracy of objects, but in the software sense. A campaign based on a good play on words.
  - The arsenal can teleport to the player, making a fun TARDIS-like noise.

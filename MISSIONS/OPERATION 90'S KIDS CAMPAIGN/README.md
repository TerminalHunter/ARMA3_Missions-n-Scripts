## Tactical Tuesday's 1st Major Campaign

### 10 Missions

Played from:
September 2019 - January 2020

### Prominent Features:

It's the first one.

Aping games like Mercenaries, features a bounty system for taking in HVT, whether alive, dead, or just their dogtags to confirm the kill

Story-heavy and kinda ad-hoc

Tech trees!

Honestly, ran this one like a D&D campaign, didn't program in a lot of it, and all the AAR's are here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aMZjcH93ACudrkgt_Yd8Y3LqpTJU66Ed4hkNEgl0gOg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.zcy0mfpv7j45
